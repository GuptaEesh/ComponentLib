## Component Library to build UI faster.

### Table of Contents:

- It has code snippets and live demos for all the components.
- This component library is built with html, css and vanilla js. 
- All the components are ready to use to create your own app faster.
- Copy paste the code and get ready to experience the power of this library.


### How to Use?

Copy CSS file mentioned in installation section and paste it in your head tag of html file.
Or you can directly copy it from here-
  ```html
  <link href="https://attr-act.netlify.app/Attract.css" rel="stylesheet">
  ```


Documentation will help you to understand look and feel of the components.

In Documentation, html code is written with visual representation of components. You can directly copy and paste in your html file.

The interesting thing is you can mix this with your own defined classes and also override it using specificity or with !important keyword.
But I would advice you to:
```diff
+ use specificity
- avoid !important
```
